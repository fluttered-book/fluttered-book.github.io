## What is Flutter?

Flutter is a powerful UI toolkit backed by Google, for crafting natively compiled
applications for mobile, web, and desktop - all from a single codebase.

## What will I learn?

**Dart**

A modern object-oriented programming language, combining some of the best features found in languages such as C\# and TypeScript.
Though it's a general purpose programming language, its features and syntax
are especially well suited for client apps.

**Flutter**

Create beautiful user experiences for all platforms, all from a single
codebase, with this UI library.
No more crazy CSS hacks to get things to look good!

**Sensors**

Explorer sensors and other special features such as gyro, camera, location and
notifications.

**Connect to APIs**

Power your app with data from APIs.
Consume JSON from web APIs.
Work with MQTT and websockets.

**Advance**

Learn advanced state management techniques and how to architect maintainable
apps.

Elevate your frontend programming game with sophisticated techniques that can be adapted and applied across frameworks.

## Approach to teaching

This textbook is built around a hands-on, project-based approach.
By the end of this book, you'll have a portfolio of mini-apps and a strong
foundation to tackle larger, more complex projects.

## Who is this book for?

This book assumes basic programming knowledge, but does not require any prior
experience with Flutter or mobile development.
If you have some understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP), you are
ready to start.

The target audience is CS students and entry-level programmers.
However, experienced developers can also use it to gain insight into best
practices, patterns and architecture.

## System requirements

To complete the exercises in this book, you need a computer with a recent version of either Windows, macOS or Linux.

8 GB of RAM is required as a minimum, however 16 GB or more is recommended.

It can be beneficial to have a supported smartphone to test your apps on,
although not strictly required.
Either Android (5.0+) or iOS (12+).

{{< hint info >}}
<b>Note:</b> You need a Mac to develop for iPhone.
This limitation is unfortunately imposed by Apple.
However as a workaround, you can <a href="docs/tricks/web" >deploy to web</a>
to use your apps on iPhone.
{{< /hint >}}

No matter your operating system, you can always run your app out on a virtual
Android device (emulator).

For most of the exercises you can also just use Chrome (web browser).
