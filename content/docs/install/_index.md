# Install

Before you can get started creating apps, you'll need to install a few things
to set up development environment for Flutter.

## 1. Flutter SDK

First you need to install the SDK.
Follow one of the guides below depending on your operating system.

- [Windows](windows)
- [macOS](mac)
- [Linux](linux)

## 2. Android Studio

You also need an editor to write your code in.
For starters, I recommend Android Studio.
And if you are already familiar with one of the JetBrains IDEs (such as IDEA,
WebStorm, Rider etc.) then you should feel right at home with Android Studio.

For iPhone users, don't be confused that its called Android Studio.
It works just as well for making app on all platforms supported by Flutter,
including iPhone.
