# Architecture

## The apps we build

Let's start by examining the architecture of the apps we build so far.

### Photos

[Link](/docs/interactivity/photos)

It got a presentation layer.
That's it.
The app is all widgets.

### Jokes

[Link](/docs/connecting-to-apis/jokes)

We have a presentation layer with `MyApp` and `JokePage`.

Then we have a data layer.
Consisting of `DataSource` and `JokeDto`.

### Weather app

[Link](/docs/weather/weather1)

It follows a similar architecture, but slightly more complex.

There are a lot more classes, so I'm not going to name them all.

### Password manager

[Link](/docs/advanced-state-management/password-manager)

Where the two previous apps where basically just consuming data from a web API.
The password manager app is a bit different.

It's all local.
Not talking to any web API.
Its goal is to manage credentials and store them in a protected way.
For that it needs more logic than the previous examples.

It got a different architecture because what is does is a lot different.
If there were one size fits all architecture we wouldn't be talking about it.

## Recommendation

For slightly bigger projects like your exam project.
You will (likely) both fetch data from an API and have logic within your app.
Which means that you will likely end up with the following layers.

Bigger apps will have many features.
A feature in this context means a piece of functionality that is somewhat
self-contained.

Let's take a shopping app as example.
It can have the following features:

- Storefront
- Product details
- Login
- Registration
- Shopping cart
- Checkout
- ...

Each feature will have its own screen, state & cubit.
Then it becomes an excellent idea to group the presentation and logic by that
feature.
Simply put everything belonging to a feature in the same sub-folder.

Data access layer can be shared between features, or it can be feature specific
depending on your app.
